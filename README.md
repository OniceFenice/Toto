# 🐾 Toto

**"Because even the smallest watchdog can make a big difference."**

**Toto** is a safety-first, open-source tool designed to help protect **gaming communities** from **sexual offenders** and **bad actors** by leveraging publicly accessible data from **national registries and criminal databases** across multiple countries.

Inspired by the ever-loyal dog from *The Wonderful Wizard of Oz*, Toto is a vigilant digital companion, sniffing out danger and alerting platforms to known threats before harm can be done.

## 🚨 Why Toto Exists

> “You can’t protect a community if you don’t know what’s lurking in it.”

This project was born from personal experience — a survivor's frustration with systemic failures that allowed a known offender to slip through cracks by using **aliases**, **false identities**, and exploiting **jurisdictional blind spots**.

Toto is here to challenge that status quo.

We’re not sugarcoating it: predators thrive in the shadows. Toto turns the light on.

## 🔒 What Toto Does

Toto automates the aggregation of **publicly available criminal data** to:

- Scan known aliases and identities across **national sex offender registries**
- Alert game developers, mod teams, and community admins if a match is found
- Support platforms in **due diligence** and **risk mitigation**
- Provide a **first line of defense** against repeat offenders in digital spaces

Toto is **not a judge, jury, or executioner** — it's a **warning system**, meant to flag known risks using verifiable data.

## 🌐 Data Sources

Toto fetches and aggregates data from national-level registries (where publicly available), including but not limited to:

- United States National Sex Offender Public Website (NSOPW)
- Canadian National Sex Offender Registry (public disclosures)
- UK Sexual Offences Register (when accessible)
- Other country-specific public registries

> ⚠️ **Note:** Data access and privacy laws vary by jurisdiction. Toto is compliant with respective public record usage policies and makes no modifications to source data.

## 💡 Vision

The long game? A safer, more transparent internet for gamers of all ages.

Toto doesn’t just identify — it **educates**, **empowers**, and **enables** communities to take **proactive** action.

We want platforms to be held accountable when they harbor known predators — *not because they ignored the warning signs, but because they were never given any*.

## 🔧 Usage

> *Setup instructions, API keys, and deployment guides to be added here.*

Toto is built with flexibility and scalability in mind. Whether you’re running a massive MMO or a Discord server, integration is the end goal.

## 🙏 Final Note

This is more than code. This is a shield.

Toto might just be a dog in a story — but in our story, it’s the one that barked when no one else would.
